# Accessible Dropdown Navigation

What are dropdown navigations? They look something similar to a box of options hanging down from the Navigation Bar. Something similar to the illustration given below.

The first and foremost step to build accessible components is to start using <a href="#">Semantic HTML</a>. So let us break down each of the components of the navigation.

1. The first step to start building the navigation is use the semantic nav HTML tag.
2. Navigation schema is composed of a list of links and should be provided as nested lists of links.
3. Attach aria attributes to the navigation for the assisstive information when using screen readers.

Let us start CODING !!

```html
<nav role="menu">
  <ul class="menu">
    <li class="menu_item">
      <a href="/about" class="menu_link">
        About
      </a>
      <ul class="submenu">
        <li class="submenu_item">
          <a class="submenu__link" href="/about/journey">
            Journey
          </a>
        </li>
        <li class="submenu_item">
          <a class="submenu__link" href="/about/team">
            Team
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="menu_item">
      <a href="/updates" class="menu_link">
        Updates
      </a>
      <ul class="submenu">
        <li class="submenu_item">
          <a class="submenu__link" href="/updates/blog">
            Blog
          </a>
        </li>
        <li class="submenu_item">
          <a class="submenu__link" href="/updates/press">
            Press
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="menu_item">
      <a href="/contact" class="menu_link">
        Contact
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

The thing to note here is since all the anchor tags are focusable, the basic
HTML skeleton of the navigation bar guven above in itself is accessible.
Something similar to this.

  style="text-align:center"
/>

However, we obviously won't like seeing something like this so let us just style
it up. For the submenu, I have used visually-hidden rather than display:none. I have omitted some general styling, you can have a look at the entire code <a href="#">here</a>.

```css
.submenu {
  position: absolute;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  height: 0.5em;
  width: 0.5em;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em); //visually-hidden
  clip: rect(0.5em, 0.5em, 0.5em, 0.5em);
}
.menu_item:hover .submenu {
  padding: 0.5em 0;
  width: 9em;
  height: auto;
  background: #111;
  clip: auto;
}
```

The navigation bar looks something like this now. However, the next thing to notice here, you cant really visually focus on the submenu options using the Tab key.

/>

To solve this issue, we have :focus-within to the rescue. It is a pseudo class which which represents an element that has received focus or contains an element which has received focus. This allows us to open the submenu when a submenu element is focused.

```css
.menu_item:hover .submenu {
  padding: 0.5em 0;
  width: 9em;
  height: auto;
  background: #111;
  clip: auto;
}
```

It works pretty well for the menus to be able to navigation forward and backward using Tab key and Shift+Tab respectively.

/>

To further make it even more functional, let us write some code to be able to switch menus using the left and right arrow key. To get started let us add add an EventListener for the same.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
  l = document.activeElement.parentElement;
  // handling for change of menu when right arrow key is clicked
  if (e.keyCode === 39) {
  }

  // handling for change of menu when right arrow key is clicked
  if (e.keyCode === 37) {
  }
});
```

Here "activeElement" gives us the the currently focused element which in this case will always be the anchor tags hence we refer to the parent element (`<li>`) of the same.

To move to the next menu i.e. when right arrow key is clicked we simply focus on the firstElementChild of the next sibling menu. The catch here is that since anchor tags are focusable and not `<li>`, we need to retrive `<a>` using the firstElement. Another thing to take care of is the fact that if the submenu item is currently focused, we need to retrive the parent menu to be able to move to the next(immediate right menu). To further clarify, have a look at the code below.

```javascript
// handling for change of menu when right arrow key is clicked
if (e.keyCode === 39) {
  if (l.classList.contains("submenu_item")) {
    //retrive the parent menu_item
    l = l.parentElement.parentElement;
  }
  if (l.nextElementSibling !== null) {
    //focus on the <a> of the previous menu_item
    r = l.nextElementSibling;
    r.firstElementChild.focus();
  }
}
```

Now that we've managed to move to the next menu_item, moving left should not be that hard.

```javascript
if (e.keyCode === 37) {
  if (l.classList.contains("submenu_item")) {
    //retrive the parent menu_item
    l = l.parentElement.parentElement;
  }
  if (l.previousElementSibling !== null) {
    r = l.previousElementSibling;
    //focus on the <a> of the previous menu_item
    r.firstElementChild.focus();
  }
}
```

Congratulations !!! You've your accessible navigation menu ready. Refer to the entire code here.

That is how a few lines of code can make your product reach out to a larger audience. Hence, always practice A11Y.
