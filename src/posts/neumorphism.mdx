# Neumorphism and Accessibility :

Amidst the hype of fancy UI designs which flood <a href="https://dribbble.com/search/neumorphism">Dribble</a>, the question is how accessible are these designs. With the outbreak of the craze around Neumorphism(New Skeuomorphism), designers are getting crazy over replacing the pre-existing designs over such new variations. 
To give a little background, Neumorphism is something like this, as shown in the image below.

The neumorphic designs give a raised or extruding effect to the components achieved by soft shadows. The whole game revolves around two shadows, one positive while one negative. The basic perception is the components in such a design should always be of a hue of the background color.

Recently, I saw one of the businesses adopting this UI design for its mobile application. The whole of LinkedIn/Twitter Community went mad over it while no one talk about accessibility. Here, I would stress on the fact that the business dealt with 'Financial Transactions' which is used by mostly every age group of the population.

Before I explicitly, highlight the issues with neumorphism, see it for yourself in the image below.

If you look closely, while we increase the Contrast Loss in our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl">NoCoffee Simulator</a>, the neumorphic components lose its shape and disappear while the text with better contrast ratio still remains visible. Hence, the main problem with such a design is <strong>LOW Contrast Ratio</strong>. The usability of any of the application does not stand a chance until all people can use this interface. Hence, people with Contrast Loss face so much problem along with visually abled people using the application in bright sunlight. The main problem here is because of no clear demarcation between the background and UI components.

Another point to highlight is this also causes problems for people with cognitive disabilities.

An interface with a lot of neumorphic components makes the interface too complicated to be comprehended. The confusion here revolves around "where to click". This makes the UI both clumsy as well as complicated.

While I highlight the accessibility issues regarding accessibility, I am not denying the possibility of "Accessible Neumorphic Interfaces". While I research my bit regarding, stay tuned to know more about including accessibility in neumorphism.
