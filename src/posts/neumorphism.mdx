Amidst the hype of fancy UI designs which flood "Dribble", the question is how accessible are these designs. With the outbreak of the craze around Neumorphism(New Skeuomorphism), designers are getting crazy over replacing the pre-existing designs over such new variations. 

To give a little background, Neumorphism is something like this.

The neumorphic designs give a raised or extruding effect to the components achieved by soft shadows. The whole game revolves around two shadows, one positive while one negative. The basic perception is the components in such a design should always be of a hue of the background color.

Recently, I saw one of the businesses adopting this UI design for its mobile application. The whole of LinkedIn/Twitter Community went mad over it while no one talk about accessibility. Here, I would stress on the fact that the business dealt with 'Financial Transactions' which is used by mostly every age group of the population.

Before I explicitly, highlight the issues with neumorphism, see it for yourself in the image below.
