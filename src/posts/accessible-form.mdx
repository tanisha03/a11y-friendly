# Accessible forms and Inputs :

Regardless to say, forms are one of the vital sources of information collected from users. It is the connection point between the users and any website. To be able to utilize it to the best, it is imperative to not leave any loose ends and make forms accessible.

Various fields are by default accessible and tabbable however other points are often ignored by developers while making these forms accessible. Let us have a look at them below:

## Use Semantics

The No.1 RULE of accessibility is the use of semantic HTML. Hence, use the tags that are best suited for the component. `<form>` , `<input>`, `<fielset>` and `<button>` are few of them.

## Form Inputs and Label

Realizing the difference between placeholders and labels is another major step to building accessible forms. Placeholders are meant for providing an example of the field whereas Labels identify the information required to be entered into the field.
Placeholders are not accessible because of the following reasons:

1. It often has a low color-contrast ratio.
2. It disappears when the user starts typing.
3. It is not accessible to the screen reader.

Hence, omitting labels and replacing them with placeholders is a big <strong>NO</strong>. Matching for and id values associate labels with the appropriate form control. Another very important benefit of labels is that clicking on the label automatically sets the focus on the field which is extremely helpful for people with motor disabilities.

```HTML
 <label for="full-name">
    Full Name
    <span class="required"> (required) </span><br>
    <input id="full-name" name="full-name" required="" type="text" />
</label>
```

The same also applies for Textareas. Labels should always be included for text areas.

## Fieldsets and Legends

Similar fields can be grouped together using fieldsets like Title, First and Last Name. Fieldset also includes a legend tag where information about the group can be displayed as a caption. These captions are read out by the screen readers to let the user give extra information.

```HTML
<fieldset>
    <legend>Personal Information</legend>
    <label for="full-name">
      Full Name
      <span class="required"> (required) </span><br />
      <input id="full-name" name="full-name" required="" type="text" />
    </label>

    <label for="email">
      Email
      <span class="required"> (required) </span><br />
      <input id="email" name="email" required="" type="email" />
    </label>
</fieldset>
```

## Option Groups

The `<optgroup>` element groups options in a select box. It requires a label attribute, the value of which is displayed as a non-selectable pseudo-heading preceding that group in the drop-down list of visual browsers.

```HTML
<select name="country">
    <optgroup label="Africa">
        <option value="gam">Gambia</option>
        <option value="mad">Madagascar</option>
        <option value="nam">Namibia</option>
    </optgroup>
    <optgroup label="Europe">
        <option value="fra">France</option>
        <option value="rus">Russia</option>
        <option value="uk">UK</option>
    </optgroup>
    <optgroup label="North America">
        <option value="can">Canada</option>
        <option value="mex">Mexico</option>
        <option value="usa">USA</option>
    </optgroup>
</select>
```

It is very crucial to include all of these in your forms to make is a11y Friendly so that you can receive data from all sections of users seamlessly.
